## What is MelodyNG?

MelodyNG ("Melody Next Generation") is the open-source successor of the internal content
management system Melody developed and used by the company MD-Netdesign. This publicly
available rewrite will be improved by splitting logic into multiple bundles, which are ready
to be used in Symfony applications above version 5.2 running on PHP 8 or greater.

The content management system provides support for various best practices to quickly
bootstrap and integrate an administration panel into your application with the least effort.

## About Core

The core bundle of MelodyNG provides support for reading metadata from entities and
transferring property values to data transfer objects. It also contains an automatic form
builder based on the given attributes on the properties of an entity.
